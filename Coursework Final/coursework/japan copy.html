            <h3>Geography</h3>
            <p>
              On the Asian continent's east coast is the island nation of Japan. Japan is the tenth most populated country in the world with a population of about 127 million. Mountains cover around 70% of the continent, while population centers have grown up around the remaining 30%. Urban areas have a high urban population density since 75% of the population resides there. 
            </p>
            <h3>Climate</h3>
            <p>
              Japan has four distinct seasons, each with its own unique characteristics. The first is a chilly, dry winter, with average temperatures ranging from about -3 to 3 degrees Celsius in the northern part of the country to 5 to 12 degrees Celsius in the south. This is followed by a mild spring that brings the famous cherry blossom season. The rainy season arrives in late June or early July, followed by hot, humid weather in August, with average temperatures ranging from about 20 to 30 degrees Celsius throughout the country. September brings typhoons and heavy rain, signaling the beginning of fall.
            </p>
            <h3>Cultural Etiquette</h3>
            <p>
